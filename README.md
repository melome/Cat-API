# Cat Don't GIF a Fact

This is a simple web application that fetches a random cat image and a random cat fact using two different APIs. When you click the "Meow!" button, it updates the cat image and displays a new cat fact.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   `git clone <repository_url>`

2. Open the project directory in your code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

4. Click the "Meow!" button to fetch a new cat image and fact.

## Usage

This application consists of an HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`index.js`). The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, the CSS file contains the styles, and the JavaScript file contains the logic for fetching cat data from APIs and updating the DOM.

## Features

- Fetches a random cat image from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) and updates the image on button click.
- Fetches a random cat fact from [Cat Facts API](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/) and displays it below the image.
- Simple and responsive design using Bootstrap.
